## 🎯 Focus Areas for Maximum Impact

Given your current excellent foundation, I recommend focusing on:

1. **📧 Email Preview & Safety** - Users need to see what they're deleting
2. **💾 Backup System** - Safety net before any deletion
3. **🔍 Advanced Search** - More precise email targeting
4. **📊 Analytics** - Show users the impact of cleanup
5. **⏰ Scheduling** - Automate regular maintenance

Your project already has excellent architecture and features. These improvements would transform it from a great tool into a comprehensive email management platform!

## 🤔 Questions for Direction

1. **Primary Use Case**: Personal use or planning to distribute/sell?
2. **Target Audience**: Technical users or general consumers?
3. **Platform Priority**: Desktop app, web app, or CLI focus?
4. **Integration Needs**: Any specific services you want to integrate with?
5. **Performance Requirements**: How large are the email accounts you're targeting?

Would you like me to implement any of these specific improvements, or would you prefer to start with a particular area that interests you most?
