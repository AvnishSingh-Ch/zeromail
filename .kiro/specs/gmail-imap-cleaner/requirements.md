# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Python script that connects to Gmail using IMAP to perform automated email management tasks. The script will delete old emails based on a configurable date cutoff and automatically unsubscribe from emails containing unsubscribe links. The solution uses only standard Python libraries and IMAP protocol (not Gmail API) to provide a lightweight, dependency-free email management tool.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect to my Gmail inbox using IMAP over SSL, so that I can securely access my emails programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL establish an IMAP SSL connection to Gmail's IMAP server
2. WHEN providing email credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate using the provided email and password variables
3. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL handle the exception gracefully and display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN connection is established THEN the system SHALL select the "INBOX" folder for operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete emails older than a specified date, so that I can automatically clean up my inbox from old messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL search for all emails in INBOX older than the configured cutoff date
2. WHEN old emails are found THEN the system SHALL delete each email and mark it for expunge
3. WHEN deleting emails THEN the system SHALL log each deleted email with relevant details (subject, date, sender)
4. IF no old emails are found THEN the system SHALL log that no emails were deleted
5. WHEN date comparison occurs THEN the system SHALL use the configurable date format "01-Jul-2023"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to find emails containing unsubscribe links, so that I can automatically unsubscribe from unwanted mailing lists.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for unsubscribe emails THEN the system SHALL search for emails containing "unsubscribe" in subject OR body
2. WHEN unsubscribe emails are found THEN the system SHALL extract the email content for link processing
3. WHEN processing email content THEN the system SHALL use regex to extract unsubscribe URLs
4. IF no unsubscribe emails are found THEN the system SHALL log that no unsubscribe emails were processed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the script to automatically send unsubscribe requests, so that I can reduce future unwanted emails without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unsubscribe links are extracted THEN the system SHALL send GET requests to each unique unsubscribe URL
2. WHEN sending unsubscribe requests THEN the system SHALL handle HTTP exceptions gracefully
3. WHEN each unsubscribe request is made THEN the system SHALL log the URL and response status
4. IF an unsubscribe request fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but continue processing other links

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want configurable settings at the top of the script, so that I can easily modify credentials and date settings without editing code logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script starts THEN the system SHALL read email credentials from configurable variables at the top of the script
2. WHEN the script starts THEN the system SHALL read the cutoff date from a configurable variable
3. WHEN configuration is defined THEN the system SHALL use only standard Python libraries (imaplib, email, re, datetime, ssl, requests)
4. WHEN configuration is set THEN the system SHALL support Gmail accounts with "less secure apps" enabled or app passwords

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive logging and error handling, so that I can monitor the script's operations and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation occurs THEN the system SHALL provide clear, descriptive log messages
2. WHEN exceptions occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN emails are deleted THEN the system SHALL log the count and details of deleted emails
4. WHEN unsubscribe requests are made THEN the system SHALL log each successful and failed attempt
5. WHEN the script completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of all operations performed
